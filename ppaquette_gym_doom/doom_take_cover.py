    ------------ Training Mission 8 - Take Cover ------------
    This map is to train you on the damage of incoming missiles.
    It is a rectangular map with monsters firing missiles and fireballs
    at you. You need to survive as long as possible.

    Allowed actions:
        [10] - MOVE_RIGHT                       - Move to the right - Values 0 or 1
        [11] - MOVE_LEFT                        - Move to the left - Values 0 or 1
    Note: see controls.md for details

    Rewards:
        +  1    - 35 times per second - Survive as long as possible

    Goal: 750 points
        Survive for ~ 20 seconds

    Ends when:
        - Player is dead (one or two fireballs should be enough to kill you)
        - Timeout (60 seconds - 2,100 frames)

    Actions:
        actions = [0] * 43
        actions[10] = 0      # MOVE_RIGHT
        actions[11] = 1      # MOVE_LEFT

    Configuration:
        After creating the env, you can call env.configure() to configure some parameters.

        - lock [e.g. env.configure(lock=multiprocessing_lock)]

            VizDoom requires a multiprocessing lock when running across multiple processes, otherwise the vizdoom instance
            might crash on launch

            You can either:

            1) [Preferred] Create a multiprocessing.Lock() and pass it as a parameter to the configure() method
                [e.g. env.configure(lock=multiprocessing_lock)]

            2) Create and close a Doom environment before running your multiprocessing routine, this will create
                a singleton lock that will be cached in memory, and be used by all Doom environments afterwards
                [e.g. env = gym.make('Doom-...'); env.close()]

            3) Manually wrap calls to reset() and close() in a multiprocessing.Lock()

    Wrappers:

        You can use wrappers to further customize the environment. Wrappers need to be manually copied from the wrappers folder.

            theWrapperOne = WrapperOneName(init_options)
            theWrapperTwo = WrapperTwoName(init_options)
            env = gym.make('ppaquette/DoomTakeCover-v0')
            env = theWrapperTwo(theWrapperOne((env))

        - Observation space:

            You can change the resolution by using the SetResolution wrapper.

                wrapper = SetResolution(target_resolution)
                env = wrapper(env)

            The following are valid target_resolution that can be used:

                '160x120', '200x125', '200x150', '256x144', '256x160', '256x192', '320x180', '320x200',
                '320x240', '320x256', '400x225', '400x250', '400x300', '512x288', '512x320', '512x384',
                '640x360', '640x400', '640x480', '800x450', '800x500', '800x600', '1024x576', '1024x640',
                '1024x768', '1280x720', '1280x800', '1280x960', '1280x1024', '1400x787', '1400x875',
                '1400x1050', '1600x900', '1600x1000', '1600x1200', '1920x1080'

        - Action space:

            You can change the action space by using the ToDiscrete or ToBox wrapper

                wrapper = ToBox(config_options)
                env = wrapper(env)

            The following are valid config options (for both ToDiscrete and ToBox)

                - minimal       - Only the level's allowed actions (and NOOP for discrete)
                - constant-7    - 7 minimum actions required to complete all levels (and NOOP for discrete)
                - constant-17   - 17 most common actions required to complete all levels (and NOOP for discrete)
                - full          - All available actions (and NOOP for discrete)

            Note: Discrete action spaces only allow one action at a time, Box action spaces support simultaneous actions

        - Control:

            You can play the game manually with the SetPlayingMode wrapper.

                wrapper = SetPlayingMode('human')
                env = wrapper(env)

            Valid options are 'human' or 'algo' (default)
