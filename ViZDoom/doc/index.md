# ViZDoom
[http://vizdoom.cs.put.edu.pl](http://vizdoom.cs.put.edu.pl)

ViZDoom allows developing AI **bots that play Doom using only the visual information** (the screen buffer). It is primarily intended for research in machine visual learning, and deep reinforcement learning, in particular.

ViZDoom is based on [ZDoom](https://github.com/rheit/zdoom) to provide the game mechanics.

## Features
- Multi-platform,
- API for C++, Lua, Java and Python,
- Easy-to-create custom scenarios (examples available),
- Async and sync single-player and multi-player modes,
- Fast (up to 7000 fps in sync mode, single threaded),
- Customizable resolution and rendering parameters,
- Access to the depth buffer (3D vision)
- Automatic labeling game objects visible in the frame
- Off-screen rendering,
- Episodes recording,
- Time scaling in async mode,
- Lightweight (few MBs).

ViZDoom API is **reinforcement learning** friendly (suitable also for learning from demonstration, apprenticeship learning or apprenticeship via inverse reinforcement learning, etc.).
